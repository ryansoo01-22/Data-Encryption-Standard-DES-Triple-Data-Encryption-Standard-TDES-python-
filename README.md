# Data-Encryption-Standard-DES-Triple-Data-Encryption-Standard-TDES-python-
Python implementation of Data Encryption Standard(DES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard(TDES)  
This python module can be used to encrypt and decrypt text.  
It includes the DES/TDES modes ECB, CBC, and OFB. 
Also included are unit tests that I did while creating the module.
At the bottom are test encryptions I used my module to decrypt.
